# Supermarket Management System

A Java-based supermarket management system developed as part of an academic software engineering course.  
The system manages products, customers, employees, sales, and reports, and demonstrates layered architecture and object-oriented design.

## Features

- Product management (add, update, remove products)
- Customer management
- Employee and shift management
- Purchase and receipt handling
- Reports and statistics on sales and activity
- Menu-driven console / UI with clear separation between layers

## Technologies

- Java  
- Maven  
- SQLite (via JDBC)  
- Layered architecture (presentation, service, domain, data)

## Project Structure

- `dev/src/Controllers` – User interface and controllers  
- `dev/src/Domain` – Core business entities and logic  
- `dev/src/Data` – Data access layer  
- `dev/src/service` – Services connecting UI and domain logic  
- `TEST` – Tests and helper classes (if applicable)

## How to Run

To run the program, execute in CMD:

```
java -jar adss2020_v02
```

Some features rely on the computer’s system clock.  
You may need to adjust your system date/time to match the dummy data in order to test certain functionalities.
